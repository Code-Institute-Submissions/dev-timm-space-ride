## Product Decisions 

### Business Needs
As a company...
- we want to be one of the first businesses that offer private space travel so that we can be ahead of the competition early on.
- we want to appeal to our target audience from the very first page visit to make them excited about the product we are offering.
- we want to make sure our product is secure so that our staff and customers feel safe far away from home.
- we want to make it as easy as possible for potential customers to get in touch with us.
- we want to increase the stickiness of our product so that we ensure the retention of our customers base.

### MVP
For the first MVP it was important to have an easy to navigate website which efficiently conveys key information. 

## Design Decisions

### User Needs
As a space enthusiast I want to... 
- experience visiting other planets first hand so that I fulfil my childhood dreams.
- know what others say about their experience with space travel so that I can choose the best provider for my journey
- know more about the process it would take to schedule a flight into space.
- be the first to know about space travelling and other related topics or news.

### Design Process
To determine the best information architecture, it was important to first build low-fi wireframes. A crucial step for this was to make sure to only focus on the information that needs to be conveyed and leave out and visual decsions. After that was done the low-fi wireframes could be turned into hi-fi wireframes including all visual details.

### Visual Design
One key focus of the website is to build up excitement for space travel the moment the user enters the homepage. The experience should feel familiar by providing a sci-fi theme.

#### Fonts
The fonts used for the website are “Orbitron” and “Roboto Mono”. Both fonts have a very technical and futuristic look and feel which make them a perfect choice for a space travel product.

#### Colors
Like with the fonts, the colors provide a futuristic look and feel. They also highlight important actions e.g. CTAs as well as interactive elements such as input fields.

#### Accessibility
Colors have enough contrast and fonts are well readable to ensure the website is accessible even for users with impaired vision.

## Features
### Navigation Bar
The navigation is fixed on the top and accessible from every page. By clicking on an navigation item on the homepage it will lead the user to the dedicated section with a smooth scrolling effect. Moreover, the navigation is responsive and will turn into a burger menu when a certain display size is reached.
